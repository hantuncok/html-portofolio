<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I just started software adventure and I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I want to design and develop websites using these languages. Web design can be both a hobby and a profession for me.</p>

<p>I love researching and learning new things. That's why a dynamic and powerful language like JavaScript is very interesting to me. I can add interactive features to web pages with JavaScript. For example, dropdowns, animations, games and more.</p>

  <p>I also love to travel. Getting to know different cultures and places gives me pleasure. I plan to take photos of the places I visited and share them on my website. Thus, I can both improve myself and inspire others.</p>
